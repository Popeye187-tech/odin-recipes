    <h2>When it comes to grilled barbecue chicken, everyone wants a nice thick barbecue glaze attached to the skin, and the only way to do it is to brush it on as it cooks. But because barbecue sauce has such a high sugar content, it only takes a minute for it to go from brick red to solid black — so you have to be careful! To ensure a sticky, sweet glaze that's not burnt, I sear the skin quickly, then cook it skin-side up on a covered grill, brushing on the glaze while it cooks</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
    <li>1 whole chicken, cut into halves</li>
    <li>cup rice vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons barbecue sauce</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li> 
    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup barbecue sauce, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <li>Cut 1/2-inch deep slashes in the skin-side of each chicken half: two cuts in each breast, two in eachi thigh, and one in each leg. Remove wing tips.</li>
    <li>Whisk vinegar, 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce, and garlic together in a large bowl. Place chicken in the bowl and turn to coat. Arrange chicken halves in the bottom of the bowl with the cut sides down; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1 hou</li>

    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels; discard any remaining marinade</li>
    <li>Cook chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill until grill marks appear, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn chicken over, close the grill lid, and cook, basting with remaining barbecue sauce every 6 minutes, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 35 minute</li>
